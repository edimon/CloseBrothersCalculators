<p>The aim of this calculator is to give you an indication of how much you need to contribute to a pension and what you might get as a retirement income. The calculator should not be regarded as personal advice. If you are at all unsure, please contact us for advice.</p>
<p>The figures are a guide and not guaranteed. Your final pension fund and the income available will depend on factors including the growth your fund achieves, contributions you make in future, charges, inflation, your retirement age, annuity rates at the time and the annuity options you choose.</p>
